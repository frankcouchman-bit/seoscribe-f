## ðŸ“‹ **ALTERNATIVE: Delete netlify.toml and use Netlify UI**

If you continue having issues, **delete the `netlify.toml` file** and configure directly in Netlify dashboard:

### **Netlify Dashboard Settings:**

1. **Build Settings:**
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
   - Node version: `18`

2. **Redirects (_redirects file):**
   Create `public/_redirects`:
```
   /*    /index.html   200
```

3. **Environment Variables:**
   Add in Netlify Dashboard â†’ Site settings â†’ Environment variables:
```
